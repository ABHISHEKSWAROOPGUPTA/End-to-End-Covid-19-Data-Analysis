# COVID-19 Data Analysis Dashboard
Welcome to the COVID-19 Data Analysis project repository! This project utilizes Python for data processing and Power BI for visualization to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic trends. The project aims to provide insights into confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries across different regions.

## Introduction
The COVID-19 Data Analysis project aimed to enhance decision-making by examining key aspects of the pandemic, such as the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries in different regions. This end-to-end project integrated various data sources and utilized Python for data processing and Power BI for visualization to present meaningful insights.

## Situation
The objective was to create a data analysis dashboard to understand COVID-19 pandemic trends and derive insights to assist in strategic planning and public health responses.

## Problem Statement
The COVID-19 Data Analysis project aimed to address several critical questions:

##### 1. Show the number of confirmed, death, and recovered cases in each region.
##### 2. Remove all the records where confirmed cases are less than 10.
##### 3. Identify the region with the maximum number of confirmed cases.
##### 4. Identify the region with the minimum number of death cases.
##### 5. Report the number of confirmed, death, and recovered cases in India till April 29, 2020.
##### 6. Sort the data with respect to the number of confirmed cases in ascending order.
##### 7. Sort the data with respect to the number of recovered cases in descending order.
## Task
Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to visualize the COVID-19 data.

## Key Features:
##### 1. Analysis of the number of confirmed, death, and recovered cases by region.
##### 2. Identification of regions with the maximum and minimum number of cases.
##### 3. Insights into the pandemic's impact on India till April 29, 2020.
##### 4. Sorting of data for better analysis and understanding.
## Project Structure:
##### 1. Python Scripts: Contains the Python scripts used for data preprocessing.
##### 2. Power BI Dashboard: The .pbix file with the Power BI dashboard.
##### 3. Documentation: Detailed project report and insights.
## Action
##### 1. Data Integration: Connected a dataset containing COVID-19 data to Python for preprocessing.
##### 2. Data Analysis: Identified key metrics including confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries by region.
##### 3. Dashboard Development: Constructed the dashboard with filters for regions and other relevant categories. Created various charts to effectively visualize the data.
##### 4. Interactive Features: Implemented interactive features to allow for filtering by multiple attributes and clearing all filters at once.
## Result
Delivered a COVID-19 data analysis dashboard that provides valuable insights for:

##### 1. Pandemic Trends Analysis: Helps in understanding the spread and impact of COVID-19 across different regions.
##### 2. Regional Impact Assessment: Assists in identifying regions with the highest and lowest number of cases.
##### 3. Case Distribution Analysis: Provides insights into the number of confirmed, death, and recovered cases.
##### 4. Data Sorting and Filtering: Allows for better analysis and understanding through sorted and filtered data views.
